# Clippy2 to Anki Converter
---
### What is it?
Clippy2 is a community add-on for Open Steno Project's stenography software Plover. The add-on tracks a user's strokes (what keypresses are called in stenography) and creates a datalog any time the user could have made a more efficient brief (what shortcuts are called in stenography).

Anki is a popular spaced repition flashcard app that burns terms into the user's memory, which is a must have for any student learning stenography.

clippy_2_to_anki is a low-weight python script that parses the clippy2 .org file into a .txt file set up for a seamless import directly into Anki flashcards.

### Who is it for?
clippy_2_to_anki is for any steno learner using Plover who wants to systematically improve their knowlege of briefs according to their self-determined usefulness. Why memorize a thousand briefs you'll never use when you already have a list of one's you would use everyday?

### Why did I make it?
Though clippy_2 is a wonderful program that generates an immense amount of data, its strength is its downfall. The amount of data may be useful to some, but the average learner doesn't need most of it, so I built this program to strip the data down into its core pieces—words and briefs—then parse those into a format that Anki can read.
